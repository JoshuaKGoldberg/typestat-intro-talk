# TypeStat

Hi!
This repository is the backing code source for the TypeStat talk at the TypeScriptNYC meetup for February 2019.

See the slides at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c0wU-8LgbC9RweEfR5yc6E7zCXw34qyMNCnAvVfDTSQ/edit?usp=sharing.

See the [TypeStat repository](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/TypeStat) too!
